Scaling: pictures can be scaled (see tranform object), or can change the Pixels per unit
- most important image to scale is the background image
- find one that fits with the aspect ratio eg pixels 512 x 320 = 512/320 = 8/5 not same as 16/9
1) set camera size to 6 or any number is fine
2) choose an aspect ratio eg 16/9
3) camera's height: 6*2 = 12
   camera's width: 16/9*12
4) setting PPU of raw files:
	look at the dimensions of the image eg 512 x 320
	PPU=320/camera's height,
	though may not fit the width, therefore need a picture that gets the aspect ratio correct


How to use sprite, animations
1) create new game object (player), with sprite renderer
2) download sprite sheet and may need to splice it into individual sprite (pictures)
3) drag a set of sprites eg sprites for walking into the game object and create a new animation eg called walking
4) repeat and place these animations into an animation folder, and animator controllor folder
5) add rigid body 2d and 2d box collision and add physics material to them
