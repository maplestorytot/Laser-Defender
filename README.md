# Laser-Defender
## Inspiration
Arcade gaming but on your phone!

## What it does
You control a spaceship and fire lasers to defeat the oncoming fleets of enemy warships.

## How We Built it
Using C# and Unity2D as well as using some free online resources, texture packs. 

## Challenges We ran into
It was difficult to set up the aspect ratios since there are so many different options

## What we learned
The main concepts I learnt in this project:
  - Setting up aspect ratios
  - Clamping movement with boundaries
  - Scrolling backgrounds
  - particles systems and VFX
